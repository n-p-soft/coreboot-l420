* What external files are needed to compile coreboot ?

You will need the Intel Management part of the BIOS (me.bin) and the
BIOS descriptor (descriptor.bin). Both can be extracted from the
original BIOS, or from a BIOS update, using the "ifdtool" located under
util/ifdtool. The original BIOS can be retrieved using an external SPI
programmer (see below), or perhaps, under Linux, using the command
"flashrom -p internal -r bios".

* How to flash the Winbond W25Q32 SPI rom ?

The SPI chip for the BIOS is located under the motherboard, near middle-
bottom side (the SPI rom for the embedded controller is not far, but to
the left when you see the backside of the motherboard, do not confuse).

Some parts of the original BIOS are locked by the chipset, so it is not
possible to use Flashrom together with the internal (chipset) programmer.
You must use an external programmer that can afford sufficient current to
the motherboard (ex. CH341, but not Minipro TL866A).

coreboot allows to unlock the locked regions of the new BIOS, so direct
flashing using internal programmer (flashrom -p internal) may work once
you are using coreboot as BIOS, but it is not recommended to do that
(do it at your own risks).
